## Quantum Chemistry

- [Daniel Crawford's C++ Quantum Chemistry Programming Project](https://github.com/CrawfordGroup/ProgrammingProjects): An excellent selection of C++ quantum chemistry projects (14 projects in total!) ranging from implementing basic Hartree--Fock SCF, Moller--Plesset Perturbation and Coupled Cluster Theory to creating your own a plugin for the popular [Psi4](https://github.com/psi4/psi4) quantum chemistry package.

## Performance Engineering

- [Denis Bakhvalov's Performance Ninja Course](https://github.com/dendibakh/perf-ninja): A superb assortment of performance related assignments covering topics in core bound (e.g., vectorization and compiler intrinsics) and memory bound operations (e.g., loop tiling and memory alignment).
  Also check out his amazing book on "Performance Analysis and Tuning on Modern CPU", which has just been updated with the [second edition](https://github.com/dendibakh/perf-book/releases/tag/2.0_release).
  A hard copy of the book can be purchased from Amazon, but a digital version is also hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/dendibakh/perf-book/releases/tag/2.0_release)
