## Introduction

I have been looking for a way of accessing my **WhatsApp conversations from my Linux** desktop.
Unfortunately, **no native Linux application** has been developed, so I thought my only option was the WhatsApp web UI.
The **web interface**, however, has been quite **buggy** and exhibits **poor performance**.
Moreover, since I prevent cookies in my web browser, not only do I need to login every time with the QR code (which is a pain) but rejecting cookies also seems to interfere with the login process, preventing me entirely from loging in.

In my search for an alternative that also supports the Linux operating system, I stumbled upon the open-source [Franz](https://meetfranz.com/) program, hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/meetfranz/franz).
It provides an interface to **all the common chat services in one place**, including WhatsApp, which works great!
However, Franz relies on a fremium business model, which **limits the number of services** that free-tier uses can use at one time and **prevents the login of self-hosted chats**, such as Zulip of Mattermost.
This was quite inconvenient as I rely on them for work communications.

## Ferdium

I was delighted to find out that there is a **fully free and open-source fork of Franz** called [Ferdium](https://ferdium.org/), which **removes all of its restrictions**.
It provides access to **huge selection of messaging services** from one place---many of which I have never even heard of.

In addition, it provides a slew of **convenient keyboard shortcuts** for navigating between the various services and contains various productivity features, such as integrated TODO lists to keep track of tasks.
Best of all, since it is built using the [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) framework, it is **platform-agnostic** and runs on Windows, Mac and, yes, Linux.

## Conclusion

Ferdium has been a **game-changer** for managing my **messaging services across platforms**.
With Ferdium, I could say goodbye to the seemingly endlessly increasing number of chat service apps that I had downloaded on all my devices.
If you are **also overwhelmed** by **all** these different **messaging services**, **Ferdium** might be the **right tool for you**!
