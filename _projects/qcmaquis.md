title: QCMaquis
description: QCMaquis is an efficient C++11 implementation of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for quantum chemical Hamiltonians in its matrix product state-matrix product operator (MPS-MPO) formulation. QCMaquis can perform, electronic structure, anharmonic vibrational/vibronic, nuclear-electronic and quantum dynamics simulations.
